# Quickstart

Install `pymport`:
```shell
npm i pymport
```

Install `numpy`, `pandas` or whatever your favorite Python package is:
```shell
npx pympip3 install numpy
```

Start using from Node.js:
```js
const { pymport, proxify } = require('pymport');
const np = proxify(pymport('numpy'));

const a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5);
const b = np.ones([2, 3], { dtype: np.int16 });
```

or

```js
import { pymport, proxify } from 'pymport';
const np = proxify(pymport('numpy'));

const a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5);
const b = np.ones([2, 3], { dtype: np.int16 });
```

Then head to the [wiki](https://github.com/mmomtchev/pymport/wiki) for the full documentation.

Or go for the quickstart by learning from the [examples](https://github.com/mmomtchev/pymport/tree/main/examples).

There is also a [medium stort](https://medium.com/@mmomtchev/using-numpy-and-pandas-in-node-js-88fe30080938) with a brief introduction.

# Supported Versions

`pymport` is unit-tested on all combinations of:

| Platforms | Versions                                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS        | Windows 2019 & 2022, Ubuntu 20.04 & 22.04, macOS 11 & 12 (x86 only) |
| Node.js   | 14.x, 16.x and 18.x                                      |
| Python    | 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11                                  |

except for the following combinations that are not supported:

* **Node.js 14.x with Python 3.11**: rebuilding from source is not possible due to `node-gyp` version being too old to support Python 3.11, upgrading `npm` or using the precompiled binaries solves this issue

* **Node.js 14.x/16.x on Ubuntu 22.04**: rebuilding from source against the system-installed Python is not possible due to Node.js containing a built-in OpenSSL 1.1 with exported symbols while the system-provided Python is built vs OpenSSL 3.0, upgrading Node.js or using the precompiled interpreter solves this issue

* **Python 3.11.x on Windows**: An upstream bug requires a specific workaround in this case [#44](https://github.com/mmomtchev/pymport/issues/44)

# `pymport` vs `PyScript/Pyodide`

Although both projects provide similar functionality, they are completely unrelated with very different design goals:
* `pymport` goal is to allow using standard Python libraries without any modification in Node.js - it brings software such as `numpy` and `pandas` to Node.js
* `Pyodide` goal is to allow using Python code in a modified interpreter both in the browser and in Node.js - it allows scripting a web page in Python
