# Installation

## Fully self-contained package (easier install)

This is supported only on Windows x64, Linux x64 and macOS x64.

```shell
npm i pymport
```

This will install the pre-built `pymport` binaries and a self-contained Python 3.10 environment.

You should use `pympip3` (or `npx pympip3` if `node_modules/.bin` is not in your `PATH`) to install packages into this environment. Running `pympip3 show pip` will show you where these packages live.

`pympip3` is simply a redirection to `node_modules/pymport/lib/binding/<platform>/python -m pip`.

## Using an existing Python environment (more compatible and more robust)

```shell
npm i pymport --build-from-source
```

This will download and rebuild `pymport` against your own already existing Python environment.

You will need a working `node-gyp` supported C++ development environment. Additionally, on Linux and macOS you will need that the `python3-embed` package in `pkg-config` works. For this, on Linux you will need the `libpython3-dev` package. On macOS the Homebrew install has everything required. On Windows you should have a working `python` command in your shell.

If you want to skip the Python library auto-detection and manually point it to an existing location, you can set `CXXFLAGS` and `LIBS` so that Python is accessible to the C++ compiler and then run

```shell
export CXXFLAGS="..."
export LIBS="..."
npm i pymport --build-from-source --external_python
```

If you need to reproduce the fully integrated Python build you can run

```shell
npm i pymport --build-from-source --builtin_python
```

`node-gyp` has first class support for `g++` on Linux, `clang` on macOS and MSVC 2019 on Windows.
It also has a somewhat lower grade support for `clang` on Linux and on Windows.

## Using an existing Python environment without rebuilding from source (risky)

This is valid on all OS, but it concerns mostly Windows users without a working C++ environment.

After installing the self-contained package, you can set the `PYTHONHOME`/`PYTHONPATH` variables to point Python to your existing environment. This requires Python 3.10, as Python libraries are not compatible across different versions.

# Usage

## Basic Principle

All Python objects co-exist with the JavaScript objects. The Python GC manages the Python objects, the V8 GC manages the JS objects. The Python GC cannot free Python objects while they are referenced by a JavaScript object.

Python objects have a `PyObject` type in JavaScript. When calling a Python function, input JavaScript arguments are automatically converted. Automatic conversion to JavaScript is possible if the context permits it through `valueOf` and `Symbol.toPrimitive`. In all other cases, an explicit conversion, using `fromJS()`/`toJS()` is needed.

An additional *(and optional)* convenience layer, `pymport.proxify`, allows wrapping a `PyObject` in a JavaScript `Proxy` object that creates the illusion of directly accessing the `PyObject` from JavaScript.

At the moment, Python code does not have access to the JavaScript objects - this requires the implementation of a similar `JSObject` type on the Python side. All JavaScript arguments are passed to Python by value. `PyObject`s are passed by reference. See the lambda examples below to get a feeling how it works.

`pymport` itself supports `worker_thread` but does not provide any locking. Unlike Node.js, Python threads share the same single environment and `PyObject`s will be shared among all threads.

## Quick Start

### Using raw `PyObject`s

You can directly use the raw `PyObject` object and call `get`/`call` each time you need to access a Python attribute or call a Python function:

```js
import { pymport } from "pymport";

// Python: import numpy as np
// np is a PyObject
const np = pymport("numpy");

// Python: a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
// a is a PyObject
const a = np.get("arange").call(15).get("reshape").call(3, 5);

// Python: a = np.ones((2, 3), dtype=int16)
// np.get('int16') is a PyObject
// (if the last argument is a plain JS object, it is considered a kwargs argument)
const b = np.get("ones").call([2, 3], { dtype: np.get("int16") });

// Python: print(a.tolist())
// PyObject.toJS() converts to JS
console.log(a.get("tolist").call().toJS());
```

### Using `proxify`

`profixy` is usually the best method to use `pymport`. It wraps every `PyObject` in a JS `Proxy` object that automatically calls `.get()` when accessing a property and `.call()` when calling a method. It also ensures that all returned values are also wrapped in a `Proxy`.

It allows for a truly natural interaction with the Python objects:

```js
import { pymport, proxify } from "pymport";

// Python: import numpy as np
// np is a JS proxy object and everything returned through this object will also be proxified
const np = proxify(pymport("numpy"));

// Python: a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
// a is a JS proxy object
const a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5);

// Python: a = np.ones((2, 3), dtype=int16)
// np.int16 is a callable PyFunction
// (if the last argument is a plain JS object, it is considered a kwargs argument)
const b = np.ones([2, 3], { dtype: np.int16 });

console.log(a.tolist().toJS());
```

However comfort comes at a price and `proxify` has a significant performance impact for very short calls.

Unlike Python, JavaScript does not support operator overloading. This means that some shortcuts in Python are to be expressed using their method call counterparts. For example `a[1]` is equivalent to `a.__getitem__(1)` and `a > b` is equivalent to `a.__gt__(b)`. Knowing this, even the most perverted pandas syntax can be expressed:

```js
// df = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(15).reshape(5, 3), columns=list(['ABC']) })
const df = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(15).reshape(5, 3), {
  columns: PyObject.list(["A", "B", "C"]),
});
assert.deepEqual(df.columns.tolist().toJS(), ["A", "B", "C"]);

// df[2:3]
// In Python this is equivalent to df.__getitem__(2:3)
// In pymport item is a shortcut for __getitem__
// Note that if the underlying object also defines an item() function, it will take precedence
// (for example numpy.ndarray.item will be preferred to PyObject.item)
const df2 = df.item(PyObject.slice({start: 2, stop: 3}));
assert.deepEqual(df2.values.tolist().toJS(), [[6, 7, 8]]);

// df[df["C"] <= 3]
// In Python this is equivalent to df.__getitem__(df.__getitem__("C").__le__(3))
const df3 = df.item(df.item("C").__le__(3));
assert.deepEqual(df3.values.tolist().toJS(), [[0, 1, 2]]);
```

Slices can be expressed too:

```js
//memoryview(b'123')[::2]
PyObject.memoryview(Buffer.from('123')).item(PyObject.slice({step: 2}))
```

### Inline Python

Inline Python is supported through `pyval` which uses Python `eval`.

`pyval` can be used to create any value that is not easily expressed in JavaScript:

```js
const memviewSlice = pyval("memoryview(b'123')[::2]");
```

Every Python **expression** can be used in `pyval` - note that `eval` expects a Python expression and not a Python statement:

```js
// fn is a PyObject
const fn = pyval("lambda x: (x + 42)");

assert.isTrue(fn.callable);
assert.strictEqual(fn.call(-42).toJS(), 0);

// with eval arguments
// (this is not a real closure as Python still does not
// have access to the JS objects - this will produce a
// Python copy of the variable x)
const array = pyval("list([1, x, 3])", { x: 4 });
assert.instanceOf(array, PyObject);
assert.deepEqual(array.toJS(), [1, 4, 3]);

// The same with a PyObject
// In this case the expression is a real closure
// x will be passed by reference in the globals of the lambda
const x = PyObject.fromJS(4);
const lambda = pyval("lambda y: (y + x)", { x });
assert.strictEqual(lambda.call(-4).toJS(), 0);

// Modules can be passed too
const np = pymport("numpy");
const py_array = pyval("np.array([2, 1, 0]).tolist()", { np });
assert.deepEqual(py_array.toJS(), [2, 1, 0]);
```

`pyval` runs the whole Python compiler chain and it is an expensive function.

### Using `toJS()` on the module object

Direct conversion of the Python module object itself to a JavaScript object is supported too, but this is the least compatible mode, as some Python constructs cannot be expressed in JS:

```js
// np is a plain JS object whose properties are the numpy methods
const np = pymport("numpy").toJS();
const a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5);
```

In theory, this allows to combine the performance of the raw access with the comfort of the `proxify`ed object. In reality however, not everything works as expected. For example, chaining won't work unless the `PyObject` is converted back to JS at every step which will outweigh all performance benefits. **Generally, `proxify` is the best way to use `pymport`.**

### More Examples

matplotlib example (this is [one of the official examples](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/bar_colors.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-bar-colors-py) *translated* to JavaScript):

```js
const { pymport, proxify } = require("pymport");

const plt = proxify(pymport("matplotlib.pyplot"));

const plots = plt.subplots(); // In Python we write fig,ax = plt.subplots()
const ax = plots.item(1);     // This a list assignment and ax is the [1] element

const fruits = ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry", "orange"];
const counts = [40, 100, 30, 55];
const bar_labels = ["red", "blue", "_red", "orange"];
const bar_colors = ["tab:red", "tab:blue", "tab:red", "tab:orange"];

ax.bar(fruits, counts, { label: bar_labels, color: bar_colors });

ax.set_ylabel("fruit supply");
ax.set_title("Fruit supply by kind and color");
ax.legend({ title: "Fruit color" });

plt.show();
```

As a last step, you should probably check the [`graph-tool` example](https://github.com/mmomtchev/pymport/blob/main/examples/graph_tool.js) for some advanced concepts when using operator overloading, lvalue references (assigning to list arrays), iterators and generators.

### Notes on functions

Since 1.1 functions can be freely passed between Python and JavaScript.

All arguments will be automatically converted when possible.

If JavaScript calls a Python function with an unsupported type (`Symbol` for example), the call will throw.

Here are a few examples of different ways of getting a Python function and calling it:
```js
// a is a callable PyObject, can be called with a.call()
const a = np.get('ones');

// b is a proxified callable PyObject, can be called with b()
// All objects returned by b() will also be proxified
const b = proxify(np).ones;

// c is a native code JS function, can be called with c()
const c = np.get('ones').toJS();
```

All three of those can also be used as a Python object to be passed as an argument to a Python function.

If the Python function throws, JavaScript will receive a normal JavaScript `Error` object containing the Python error message prefixed with `Python exception`. This object will be extended with an additional attribute, `pythonTrace` which will be a `PyObject` containing the Python traceback.

When passing a JavaScript function to Python, the resulting object has a special Python type `pymport.js_function`, that cannot be constructed in any other way. It is a Python callable that is otherwise indistinguishable from a Python function. If Python calls this function with an unsupported argument type, the JavaScript function will receive a `PyObject` for this argument. If the JavaScript function throws, Python will receive a generic `Exception` object containing the JavaScript error message. If Python does not handle this error, the error will eventually propagate back to the calling JavaScript code where it will be a JavaScript `Error` object containing a `pythonTrace` with the Python part of the stack.

# Performance

*   Generally when using Python, you will get the usual Python performance, while when using Node.js, you will get the usual Node.js performance
*   Performance is significantly better with Python 3.9 or later because of the fast call protocol
*   Calling into Python from JS is more expensive than Python to Python, tests show that using Node.js with Python 3.9+ for numpy arrays:
    *   of 8 elements is 4 times slower using raw access and 10 times slower using `proxify`
    *   of 512 elements is 3 times slower using raw access and 4 times slower using `proxify`
    *   of 8192 elements, there is no significant difference with raw access and `proxify` is 25% slower
    *   of 32768 elements, there is no significant difference whatever the access method is
*   It is possible to mix raw access and `proxify` - the underlying `PyObject` can be accessed as the `__PyObject__` from a proxy object
*   `toJS()` and `fromJS()` are the most expensive parts as they copy objects between the Python and the JavaScript heap
    *   For best performance try to keep objects in Python and in JavaScript as much as possible and avoid moving them
*   The memory usage of your program will be the sum of the memory usage of a Python interpreter (not that much) and a Node.js interpreter (more significant)
*   The two GCs should work very well in tandem

# Architecture Overview

![Architecture Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmomtchev/pymport/main/overview.svg)

# Known Issues

*   In 1.0 the V8 GC does not take into account the memory held by a `PyObject`s when deciding if they should be GCed or when the heap limit has been reached
*   In 1.1 the V8 GC takes into account the memory held by a `PyObject` when it is initially referenced in JS but not its eventual growth after being referenced
*   In 1.0 Python objects of type function never expire, so you will be leaking memory if you create Python lambdas in a loop (fixed in 1.1)
*   [#3](https://github.com/mmomtchev/pymport/issues/3), `PyOBject`s are leaking memory in synchronous loops

# Supported Versions

`pymport` is unit-tested on all combinations of:

| Platforms | Windows x64, Linux x64 and macOS x64 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Node.js   | 14.x, 16.x and 18.x                  |
| Python    | 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11              |

# Future Plans

*   More features allowing direct interaction with `PyObject`s from JS
*   (longer term) Asynchronous calling / Promises on the JS side vs multi-threading on the Python side
*   (longer term) Generate TypeScript bindings from the Python modules
*   (longer term) **Using Node.js packages from Python**, ie, an eventual *`jimport`* project, is currently blocked by [PR#4352](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43542)

# Alternatives

There is an alternative package that is more mature but with slightly different target use called [`node-calls-python`](https://github.com/hmenyus/node-calls-python).

`node-calls-python` is geared towards calling large monolithic Python subroutines. It supports asynchronous calling as it is expected that those will take significant amount of CPU time. `node-calls-python` does type conversions on each call.

`pymport` is geared towards intensive use of Python libraries in Node.js. It may support asynchronous calling in the future. The main difference is that `pymport` keeps the `PyObject` objects visible in JavaScript. For example, it allows creating a `numpy` array, then using the various `numpy` methods without converting the array back to JavaScript.
